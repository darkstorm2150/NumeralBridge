# NumeralBridge: Arabic to Simplified Chinese Converter

Welcome to NumeralBridge, a C++ program designed for converting Arabic numerals into their Simplified Chinese counterparts. This project started as a learning endeavor to understand arithmetic and explore the intricate relationship between different numeral systems. As my fascination with the translation from Arabic to Simplified Chinese numerals grew, so did this program.

Currently, NumeralBridge can accurately convert numbers up to 999 million, offering an intuitive and user-friendly way to explore Chinese numerals. While the journey started with arithmetic, it quickly evolved into a passion project, combining elements of language learning and cultural exploration.

Features:
- Conversion of Arabic numerals to Simplified Chinese numerals.
- Handles numbers up to 999 million.
- User-friendly interaction and clear output.

As I continue to learn and grow, more features will be added to this program. For now, enjoy using NumeralBridge for educational, linguistic, or just plain curiosity-driven purposes!
